MTG Commander LifeCounter App

A simple tool designed to help keep track of counters in Magic: The Gathering games. 
After struggling to find an app that works with very old browsers, I developed this web-based app that runs on iOS 9 and its corresponding version of Safari, 
without the need for jailbreaking or any additional setup.

This app breathes new life into my outdated iPad, allowing it to serve a useful purpose again!

Installation
Open your old browser on your device.
Navigate to the web app URL.
To add the app to your Home Screen for quick access, tap the "Share" button and select "Add to Home Screen."
The app will now appear on your Home Screen, and you can access it just like a native app.
